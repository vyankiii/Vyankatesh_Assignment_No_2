1.	Write a Java program to create an interface Shape with the getArea() method. Create three classes
    Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle that implement the Shape interface. Implement the getArea() method
    for each of the three classes.

2.	Write a Java program to create a base class Animal (Animal Family) with a method called Sound(). 
    Create two subclasses Bird and Cat. Override the Sound() method in each subclass to make a 
    specific sound for each animal.

3.	Write a Java program to create a class Vehicle with a method called speedUp(). Create two sub 
    classes Car and Bicycle Override the speedUp() method in each subclass to increase the vehicle's 
    speed differently.

4.	Write a Java program to overload a add() method.

5.	Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with methods called getPerimeter() and 
    getArea(). Create a subclass called Circle that overrides the getPerimeter() and getArea() 
    methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle.

6.	Write a Java program to create a class called Vehicle with a method called drive(). Create 
    a subclass called Car that overrides the drive() method to print "Repairing a car".

7.	Write a Java program that creates a class hierarchy for employees of a company. The base class 
    should be Employee, with subclasses Manager, Developer, and Programmer. Each subclass should have
    properties such as name, address, salary, and job title. Implement methods for calculating 
    bonuses, generating performance reports, and managing projects.

8.	Write a Java program to create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method called sound(). 
    Create subclasses Lion and Tiger that extend the Animal class and implement the sound() method to
    make a specific sound for each animal.

9.	Write a Java program to create an abstract class Person with abstract methods eat() and exercise().
    Create subclasses Athlete and LazyPerson that extend the Person class and implement 
    the respective methods to describe how each person eats and exercises.
    
10.	Write a Java program to create an abstract class Bird with abstract methods fly() and makeSound().
    Create subclasses Eagle and Hawk that extend the Bird class and implement the respective methods
    to describe how each bird flies and makes a sound.
